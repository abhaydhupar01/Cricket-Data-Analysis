# Cricket-Data-Analysis
Welcome to my Git repository for my cricket data analysis project, where I explored and analyzed the data of the T20 Cricket World Cup 2022. This project involved web scraping data from the website of ESPN Sports using Python, transforming and validating it to ensure accuracy and reliability. The analyzed data was then visualized using Power BI and presented in an interactive dashboard.

Through this project, I aimed to extract meaningful insights and trends from the T20 Cricket World Cup 2022 data, including team performance, individual player statistics, and match outcomes. By leveraging advanced analytical techniques and visualization tools, I was able to uncover hidden patterns and relationships in the data, offering valuable insights to both fans and professionals in the cricket industry.

The code and documentation in this repository provide a detailed account of my data analysis process, from web scraping and data cleaning to visualization and dashboard creation. This repository is a valuable resource for those looking to learn more about data analysis and visualization techniques in the context of cricket sports.

Thank you for visiting my Git repository, and please feel free to explore and provide feedback on my work.
